# Stella

Rapid elixir library providing implementations of the most famous algorithms, data structures and math functions. Key features of this library are:
- a high test coverage (near to 100%)
- good quality documentation with examples of usage to each function
- featured complexity of each action

## Installation

The package can be installed by adding `stella` to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`:

```elixir
def deps do
  [
    {:stella, "~> 0.4.0"}
  ]
end
```
